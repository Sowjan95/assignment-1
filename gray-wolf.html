      Also called the timber wolf, gray wolves are the largest members of the canine family. 
      Devoted parents and families, they are also among the most social carnivores. 
      Once possessed of the greatest range of any terrestrial mammals except humans, 
      they are now restricted in North America mainly to Alaska, Canada and wilderness in the northern United States.
